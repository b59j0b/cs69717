Trend analysis of key components of the Balance Sheet:

liabilities, equity,   loans, deposits,   using critical thinking to   explain   impact factors   and   Blomberg   resources
•             Use charts or graphs to   show trends   in   these   metrics   overtime   and   highlight   any   significant changes or areas of   concern   by   using   Bloomberg figures   built
• 
•             Be sure to explain the   reasons   behind the   trends   you   observe   and   link   them   to   broader economic or   industry factors or   legal frameworks.

A video creation 
Creating your video submissions via two   main ways:
i).Using Adobe Spark Video to create animation style videos 
ii).Using Zoom to create screencast presentations. The   video   can   also   contain   PowerPoint   slides   and   be   delivered   as   an   oral   presentation   and   recorded. After consulting with the   lecturer,   it   is   possible to   use other   presentation   software   to   complete the   presentation. You   can   use   one   or   more   of the video-making tools   that   have   been   presented to you (ScreenCastify, AdobeSpark,   VideoScribe), or you can also   use a   more   complex one   (Adobe creative   cloud).
The sophistication of the tool you   use   is one   of the   assessment   criteria.
If you only   use your   mobile   phone to   upload a talking-head video, you are   unlikely   to   achieve   the   highest   passing grade.It   is   recommended   that   you   do   a   trial   presentation   in   advance   to   check   and   see   if   you   can   deliver   the   display   within   the   time   limit   allocated   (max   5   minutes). The   presentation   should   include the   bank   name and the student   number.
Useful tips Can two students research on the same bank? -No. Therefore,   pick the   bank you want to work on as soon as   possible and   let   me   know when   you are sure of   it.   I will   update   the   list   of   banks/companies that   have   been   chosen,   so   please   remember   to   check   whether   there   is   any   choice   clash.   If   somebody   else   has   announced   the   company you   plan to work on ahead of   you,   you   will   need   to   change   your   target   bank.Attend lectures and seminars:   These   sessions   will   provide   essential   details   about   each   task   and   expected   outcomes. Actively   participate   to   ensure   a   comprehensive   understanding   and   ask clarifying questions   if   needed.
Choose wisely: Select a   bank operating   in the   designated country   of   origin   (e.g.,   UK).
Crucial:   Provide documented   proof of   registration from the   relevant authority   (e.g., Companies   House for   UK   banks).   Ensure your chosen   bank   remains the same throughout   this   project and   blog   project, as   lecturer approval   is   required. 
Captivate with narrative: Craft a compelling video   presentation   (5-8   minutes) that   weaves   a   strategic   narrative and showcases your storytelling skills.   Remember,   dry   facts   and   figures alone won't suffice.   Engage your audience with a   captivating   story   that   brings   financial      concepts to   life.   Offer tips on speaking clearly,   maintaining good   pacing,   and   effectively   conveying your   points through voice and tone.
Student participation during the seminar   is   important to finish this task   and   it   is the considerable factor for final   mark   (seminar active   participation, submission to   Canvas)
